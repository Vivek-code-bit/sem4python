# Dynamic Salary Retirement Model

## Introduction

Hi, I'm Naman Choudhary and this project simulates the progression of a salary and wealth accumulation over time. The model factors in salary growth through promotions, cost-of-living raises, and wealth accumulation via savings and investment returns. It helps estimate how many years it would take to achieve a desired retirement corpus.

## Features:
- **Dynamic Salary Growth**: Accounts for cost-of-living raises and periodic promotions.
- **Wealth Accumulation**: Tracks savings based on salary and interest rate over the years.
- **Retirement Calculation**: Estimates how long it will take to reach a targeted retirement corpus.

## How to Use:
1. **Clone** or **Download** the repository.
2. Adjust the parameters such as `starting_salary`, `promos_after_every_n_years`, `cost_of_living_raise`, `promo_raise`, and `desired_cash` in the `ModelInputs` class.
3. Run the script to simulate salary and wealth progression.
4. Analyze the results to determine your estimated retirement timeline.

## Installation

To use the model, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to install the required libraries:
